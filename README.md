# Get Strava Access Token

Go to [https://www.strava.com/settings/api](https://www.strava.com/settings/api)
and register an application. Only need to fill in a name and callback domain.
For name pick whatever, for callback domain pick localhost.

After registering, you will see a table with one of the rows stating "Your
Access Token". Click on the show link to the right of it to see it. This token
is needed to access your data, so this is what you have to add to the
configuration of this application.
